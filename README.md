# TrySQLiteORMs.NET
Trying out ORMs for working with SQLite on .NET Framework.

The purpose of this repo is to find out SQLite .NET ORM that is appropriate for me.
I need it to be simple, fast, "code first" and, optionally but desirable, to have the ability to generate
DTO classes from an existing database.

My working environment is VS2012. For simplicity I will use .NET 4.5.

What is to research:

* EntityFramework6
* [ServiceStack.OrmLite](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite)
* [sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net)
* [Dapper](http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/)
* [PetaPoco](http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/)
* [Massive](https://github.com/robconery/massive)
* [Simple.Data](https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data)


## NoORM_SystemDataSQLite
Just simple querying with System.Data.SQLite.
